Code for basic C language functionality.

BMI Calulator and Categorizer PROGRAM

C program that calculates and categorizes individuals based on their Body Mass Index (BMI). 
It first defines some constants and variables for the program. 
Then, it enters a loop where it takes input for a person's height and weight, calculates their BMI, and categorizes them as:
underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on predefined BMI thresholds. 
The program keeps a count of the number of individuals in each category. 
The loop continues until the user decides to stop entering data. 
Finally, the program displays the total number of people processed and the count of people in each BMI category.

Geometric Shape Property Calculator PROGRAM

C program for processing geometric shapes, including circles, rectangles, and squares. 
It allows the user to input data for these shapes and calculates various properties, such as perimeter and surface area. 
The program keeps track of the largest perimeter for circles, the largest surface area for rectangles, and the smallest side length for squares. 
It also calculates the average perimeter for rectangles if any were processed. 
The program continues to process shapes until the user decides to stop. 
Finally, it displays statistics on the shapes processed, including the number of each type of shape and their respective properties.
